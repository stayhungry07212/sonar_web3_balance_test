## Description

API ENDPOINTL 
```bash
localhost:3000/{wallet_address}/{contract_address}
```
Moralis Speedy Node is used for a web3 provider to get token balance and regarding decimals.
As for bscscan api, they need a paid tier for getting exact token prices.
I checked poocoin and pancakeswap how they calculate the price. As I see they call continously the bsc-dataseed through web3.js, but I didn't find the solution yet.
Bitquery provide delayed price.
So I decided to use Moralis web3 api.
Web3 has no concept of token value, as the value is speculative and differs between different markets.
